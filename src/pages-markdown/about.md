Greetings! I am a web application developer based out of Apex, NC. I've been doing web development since 2008 and have dabbled in many different platforms and technologies over the years. My primary focus is Drupal 8 specializing in back end module development and large scale content migrations. I also really enjoy working in modern javascript frameworks and exploring new front end technologies.
