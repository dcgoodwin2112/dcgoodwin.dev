Greetings! I am a web application developer based out of Apex, NC. I've been doing web development since 2008 and have dabbled in many different platforms and technologies over the years. My primary focus is Drupal 8 specializing in back-end module development and large content migrations. I also really enjoy working in modern javascript frameworks and exploring new front-end technologies.

Some of my current favorite technologies and tools are PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript, Drupal, React, and Gatsby, but I'm always on the lookout for new things to try out. My current code editor of choice is vscode.

When I'm not programming or learning new technologies, I enjoy playing guitar, bass, and synth. I've played with multiple bands in the area and am currently playing guitar in Fredfin Wallaby and Laser Witch Queens.
