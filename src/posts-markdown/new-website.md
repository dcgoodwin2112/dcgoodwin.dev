After primarily focusing on Drupal 8 sites and modules over the past few years, I decided it was time to try something new and redo my personal website using Gatsby. At first I was planning to use Gatsby as the front end only and still use Drupal 8 to drive the back end CMS functionality, but ultimately I decided to go with a pure Gatsby build utilizing simple markdown files for both pages and posts. There were many factors that went into this decision, but the main reason was that it just wasn't necessary for what I needed. Adding a database and back end adds a significant amount of overhead to any project and as someone who spends all day in terminal windows and text editors, writing content in vscode actually ended up being more comfortable for me than using a traditional web content interface.

## Why Not Use Drupal?

I still love Drupal and use it every single day. It is a large and complex system though. For a simple site like this, I just didn't need most of the functionality that Drupal offers. The web development landscape is also changing and JavaScript frameworks are taking over the front-end web development space at a brisk pace. Do I think PHP based CMS jobs are going away any time soon? Of course not. However, I do believe that strong core JavaScript and modern JS framework skills will become necessary for most web developers going forward. It's no longer feasible to be just a Drupal or Wordpress developer in most cases. Redoing this site in Gatsby gave me a chance to really focus on updating my JS toolbox and I do feel like I've picked up quite a few new skills along the way.

## What's So Great About Gatsby?

Gatsby is a static site generator and CMS front end in one. Gatsby sites are built in ReactJs and GraphQL, but get rendered down to blazing fast html and javascript before getting pushed up to a hosting environment. There are many plugins available to support different CMS back ends, so the same framework can be used as the front end for many types of web projects. The documentation for Gatsby is superb for an open source project and the community behind the project is active and extremely positive. Overall, I'm am quite impressed with what Gatsby has to offer and plan to use it heavily for future projects.
